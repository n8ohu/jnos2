This is a copy of some of the material off my official JNOS 2.0 project page.

The official JNOS 2.0 project page is actually located at the following URL :

    http://www.langelaar.net/projects/jnos2

Some of the material has been placed on github for the following reasons :

    1) some people have asked me to do so.

    2) my servers located at 'home' might die, so this is a good backup.

    3) it might just happen that me, myself, and I could die, so if I do,
       then at least all of the stuff on github will stick around for a
       while. The servers at home could just vanish because the family
       has decided to pull the plug and sell the house type of thing :)

Files contained in this repository :

   file : README - this file that you are reading right now.

   file : jnos2.0j.6r.tar.gz - complete source with a makefile.

   directory : src - complete source for easy perusal, or if you simply need
                     to download a few files instead of the whole thing.

   directory : doc - contains the following ...

      file : compile.txt - instructions to compile the program

      file : changes.txt - release history

This will be of course added to as time permits, but it's a start.
